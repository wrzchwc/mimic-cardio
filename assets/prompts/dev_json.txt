I am going to provide you with the description of the data contained within the JSON data to make it easier to analyze,
avoid confusion, and reduce the amount of work required to understand the context.

All the dates in the data are shifted into the future for the anonymization purposes. The actual admissions occurred
between 2008 and 2022.

Each piece of data (I will be referring to it as a case) is a modular object. Some information is described directly
on the root level of the object, others are nested within top level properties.

Let's start with the root level properties:
- hadm_id - numeric identifier of hospitalization (hospital stay)
- subject_id - numeric identifier of the patient being hospitalized
- admission_type - admission urgency classifier, possible values are: AMBULATORY OBSERVATION, DIRECT EMER.,
DIRECT OBSERVATION, ELECTIVE, EU OBSERVATION, EW EMER., OBSERVATION ADMIT, SURGICAL SAME DAY ADMISSION, URGENT
- admission_location - information about the location of the patient prior to arriving to hospital
- admittime - date and time the patient was admitted to the hospital
- edregtime - date and time at which the patient was registered at the emergency department
- edouttime - date and time at which the patient was discharged from the emergency department
- deathtime - date and time of in-hospital death of the patient, present only if patient died in the hospital
- dischtime - date and time the patient was discharged from the hospital

There are five nested top level properties in each case:
- patient - provides more details about patient being hospitalized
- ed - describes patient stay in emergency department, present only if patient visited emergency department during
hospitalization
- icu - describes patient stay in intensive care unit, present only if patient visited intensive care unit during
hospitalization
- lab - contains results of all laboratory studies that were performed on patient-sourced specimens no later than
dischtime, meaning the data from the hospitalization itself as well as historical data is included
- microb - contain results of all microbiology studies that were performed on patient-sourced specimens no later than
dischtime, meaning the data from the hospitalization itself as well as historical data is included

patient property contains three properties:
- gender - genotypical sex of the patient
- race - race of the patient
- anchor_age - age of the patient in the year of admission; if the real age of the patient was greater than 89 (e.g., 91
it is shifted down to 89); for the neonates the age will be set to 0

ed property has four root level properties:
- intime - date and time of the admission to emergency department
- outtime - data and time of the discharge from the emergency department
- arrival_transport - method through which the individual arrived at the emergency department, possible values are:
WALK IN, AMBULANCE, UNKNOWN, OTHER, HELICOPTER
- disposition - method through which the individual left the emergency department, possible values are: HOME, ADMITTED,
TRANSFER, LEFT WITHOUT BEING SEEN, OTHER, LEFT AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE, ELOPED, EXPIRED

ed property has four nested properties:
- triage - information about the patient when they were first triaged in the emergency department
- medrecon - survey regarding medicaments taken by patient on regular basis
- vitalsigns - routine vitalsigns measurements
- pyxis - medicine dispensations made via the Pyxis system

Records in triage property have nine root level properties:
- temperature - patient’s temperature in degrees Fahrenheit. Some temperatures may be incorrectly documented as Celsius
- heartrate - patient’s heart rate in beats per minute
- resprate - patient’s respiratory rate in breaths per minute
- o2sat - patient’s peripheral oxygen saturation as a percentage
- sbp - patient’s systolic blood pressure (mmHg)
- dbp - patient’s diastolic blood pressure (mmHg)
- pain - level of pain self-reported by the patient, on a scale of 0-10
- acuity - order of priority based upon acuity utilizing the Emergency Severity Index (ESI) Five Level triage system.
This priority is assigned by a registered nurse. Level 1 is the highest priority, while level 5 is the lowest priority.
- chiefcomplaint - deidentified free-text description of the patient’s chief complaint

Records in medrecon property have four root level properties:
- name - name of the medication
- ndc - National Drug Code for the medication
- etccode - code of the Enhanced Therapeutic Class
- etcdescription - description of the Enhance Therapeutic Class

Records in vitalsigns property have nine root level properties:
- charttime - time at which the vital signs were charted
- temperature - patient’s temperature in degrees Fahrenheit. Some temperatures may be incorrectly documented as Celsius
- resprate - patient’s respiratory rate in breaths per minute
- o2sat - patient’s peripheral oxygen saturation as a percentage
- sbp - patient’s systolic blood pressure (mmHg)
- dbp - patient’s diastolic blood pressure (mmHg)
- rhythm - patient’s heart rhythm
- pain - patient’s self-reported level of pain on a scale from 0-10. The pain is documented as free-text and may
contain non-numeric entries.

Records in pyxis contain three properties:
- charttime - time at which the medication was charted, which is the closest approximation to the time the medication
was administered
- name - name of the medicine
- gsn - Generic Sequence Number (GSN), an ontology which provides a code for each medicine

icu property contains two root level properties
- intime - date and time patient was transferred to the intensive care unit
- outtime - date and time patient was transferred out of the intensive care unit

icu property contains two nested properties:
- chartevents_numeric - events charted during ICU stay that have numeric value, and can be aggregated
- chartevents_descriptive - events charted during ICU stay that have descriptive value and cannot be aggregated

Records in chartevents_numeric have five properties:
- label - descriptor of the charted phenomena
- valueuom - unit of measure of the value
- avg_value - average value charted during ICU stay
- min_value - minimum value charted during ICU stay
- max_value - maximum value charted during ICU stay

Records in chartevents_descriptive have three properties:
- label - descriptor of the charted phenomena
- value - value of the measured phenomena
- charttime - date and time when value was charted

Records in lab property have seven properties:
- label - represented concept
- fluid - substance on which the measurement was made
- charttime - date and time measurement was made
- specimen_id - Uniquely denoted the specimen from which the lab measurement was made. Most lab measurements are made
on patient-derived samples (specimens) such as blood, urine, and so on. Often multiple measurements are made on the
same sample. The specimen_id will group measurements made on the same sample, e.g., blood gas measurements made on the
same sample of blood.
- value - result of laboratory measurement
- valuenum - numeric value of the measurment result (if applicable)
- valueuom - unit of measuremnt of laboratory concept

Records in microb property have fifteen properties:
- spec_type_desc - specimen which is tested for bacterial growth
- test_name - test performed on the given specimen
- org_name - the organism, if any, which grew when tested. If NULL, no organism grew (i.e. a negative culture).
- ab_name - antibiotic tested against the given organism for sensitivity (if tested)
- chartdate - the time at which an observation was charted
- charttime - the same as charttime, except there is no time available
- comments - deidentified free-text comments associated with the microbiology measurement
- dilution_comparison - dilution values when testing antibiotic sensitivity
- dilution_text - dilution values when testing antibiotic sensitivity
- dilution value - dilution values when testing antibiotic sensitivity
- interpretation - interpretation of the antibiotic sensitivity, and indicates the results of the test. “S” is
sensitive, “R” is resistant, “I” is intermediate, and “P” is pending
- isolate_num - for testing antibiotics, the isolated colony (integer; starts at 1).
- micro_specimen_id - uniquely denoted the specimen from which the microbiology measurement was made. Most microbiology
measurements are made on patient-derived samples (specimens) such as blood, urine, and so on. Often multiple
measurements are made on the same sample. The micro_specimen_id will group measurements made on the same sample, e.g.,
organisms which grew from the same blood sample.
- quantity
- test_seq. - if multiple samples are drawn, the test_seq will delineate them
